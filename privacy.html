            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
            <p class="subtitle">Last Updated: November 30, 2025</p>

            <p>This policy applies to all information collected or submitted on FuelUp’s website, iOS app, Watch app, and CarPlay integration.</p>

            <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
            <p>We do not collect personal information such as your name, email address, or phone number directly. Our app prioritizes your privacy and functions without requiring user accounts.</p>

            <h2>Location Data</h2>
            <p>FuelUp uses your device's location services to find gas stations near you. This location data is processed locally on your device or sent anonymously to our fuel price provider APIs solely to retrieve station data. We do not store, track, or sell your location history.</p>

            <h2>App Settings & Favorites</h2>
            <p>All of your app settings, search preferences, price history logs, and favorite stations are stored locally on your device. If you use FuelUp Pro with iCloud Sync enabled, this information is synced securely between your own devices using Apple's iCloud infrastructure. We do not have access to this data.</p>

            <h2>Analytics</h2>
            <p>FuelUp operates with a strict no-tracking policy. We do not use third-party analytics services (like Google Analytics or Mixpanel) to track your usage behavior within the app.</p>

            <h2>In-App Purchases</h2>
            <p>Our iOS app uses Apple's StoreKit to manage the in-app purchase functionality for FuelUp Pro (Monthly, Yearly, and Lifetime). Apple processes all financial transactions. We do not receive or process your payment information, such as credit card numbers.</p>

            <h2>Third-Party Connections</h2>
            <p>The app connects to public APIs to display fuel prices and station details. It may also interact with Apple Maps, Google Maps, or Waze for navigation purposes at your request. These interactions are subject to the privacy policies of those respective services.</p>

            <h2>Your Consent</h2>
            <p>By using our website or apps, you consent to our privacy policy.</p>

            <h2>Contacting Us</h2>
            <p>If you have questions about this Privacy Policy, you may email <a href="mailto:shubham.shahh23@gmail.com">shubham.shahh23@gmail.com</a>.</p>
