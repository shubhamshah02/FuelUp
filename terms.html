            <p>This site and the mobile applications and services available in connection with this site and mobile application (the “App”) are made available to you by Shubham Shah (“We”) subject to these Terms of Service, including those set forth in the Privacy Policy (the “Terms”).

            <h2>Data Accuracy & Availability</h2>
            <p>FuelUp relies on third-party data sources and community reporting to provide fuel price information. While we strive for accuracy, we cannot guarantee that the prices displayed in the App will always match the price at the pump. We are not responsible for any discrepancies, outdated prices, or unavailable stations. The App is provided "as is".</p>

            <p>If you choose to buy a subscription to the App (FuelUp Pro), payment will be charged to your Apple ID account at the confirmation of purchase. The subscription automatically renews unless it is canceled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period. You can manage and cancel your subscriptions by going to your account settings on the App Store after purchase.</p>
            
            <p>Lifetime purchases are one-time payments and do not renew.</p>

            <h2>Refunds</h2>
            <p>All purchases are final. We cannot issue refunds for purchases charged to your Apple ID; refund requests must be directed to Apple Support.</p>

            <h2>General Use</h2>
            <p>The App is for your personal and noncommercial use. You may not modify, copy, distribute, transmit, display, perform, reproduce, publish, license, create derivative works from, transfer or sell for any commercial purposes any portion of the App.</p>
